This error can occur because of a policy setup error on the peer. For example, the firewall may be configured to only accept encrypted Telnet traffic to the outside interface port 23. If you attempt to use Telnet without IPsec encryption to access the outside interface on port 23, this message appears, but not with Telnet or traffic to the outside interface on ports other than 23. This error can also indicate an attack. This message is not generated except under these conditions (for example, it is not generated for traffic to theSecureFirewall ASAinterfaces themselves). See messages 710001, 710002, and 710003, which track TCP and UDP requests. This message is rate limited to no more than one message every five seconds."
