When you have identified the router with the duplicate address issue the vines routing recompute command on both routers or issue the enable vines routing  command specifying specify a unique address. If one of the routers  does not support the recompute keyword disable VINES on that router  issue the write terminal command to save the configuration to memory  reboot the router and then enter the vines routing command with a unique vines address on the offending routers until each router has a unique address.\" Unless the user configures the router otherwise Cisco routers derive  VINES network addressesfrom the Banyan reserved manufacturer identifier  for Cisco and an interface MAC address. Duplicate address assignment is  rare but does occur when the least-significant 21 bits of the interface  MAC addresses are identical. Under certain circumtances such as when the second interface in line has same MAC address on both routers VINES comes up with the same address after address recomputation. This problem was corrected in CSCdi51823. If the router has only serial interfaces and does not have an interface that can provide MAC address  it uses a random number from the internal clock. If this problem occurs there is no need to submit a DDTS. Recommend that the user manually  assign a unique address or that they upgrade to a software release that includes the fix for CSCdi51823."

   "This message is an early warning that the map-cache size is approaching its limit. The limit may be reached during normal operation if a PITR encounters traffic to many different EID-prefixes though this may also occur if someone is performing an address-space scan. If the cache size limit is reached new entries will replace old/inactive ones as required. If the map-cache limit is set too low actively used EID-to-RLOC mappings may be replaced continously which causes traffic to be dropped while these mappings are re-acquired. As long as only inactive map-cache entries are replaced the impact should not be significant. Furthermore it is worth noting that it is normal for the cache to have a limit for example to set an upper limit on the amount of memory required. To diagnose this issue it may be helpful to inspect the map-cache using show ip[v6] lisp [eid-table <vrf>] map-cache. It can also be cleared with clear ip[v6] lisp [eid-table <vrf>] map-cache. This syslog message can be turned off by removing the warning-threshold <percentage> configuration statement from the map-cache-limit configuration."

The limit may be reached during normal operation if a PITR discovers a large number of dynamic hosts in the EID-prefix ranges enabled for dynamic learning. If the dynamic local database size limit is reached new hosts will not be discovered. It is worth noting that it is normal for the local database to have a limit for dynamic entries for example to set an upper limit on the amount of memory required. To diagnose this issue it may be helpful to inspect the local database using show ip[v6] lisp [eid-table <vrf>] database. The entries can also be cleared with clear lisp[eid-table <vrf>] dynamic-eid. If this is a warning for approaching the limit this syslog message can be turned off by removing the warning-threshold <percentage> configuration statement from the database-mapping limit dynamic configuration."

RSVP uses the specified key chain to authenticate each RSVP message exchanged with that set of RSVP neighbors after the association is configured. Subsequently the specified ACL has been reconfigured such that the key chain association is no longer valid for one or more RSVP neighbors in the set. This causes RSVP to search the configuration for another suitable key chain to use with those neighbors. If no such key chain is found RSVP will no longer be able to provide authentication for messages exchanged with those RSVP neighbors. This causes RSVP to discard RSVP messages from that set of neighbors. Because this may ultimately lead to loss of RSVP functionality with those neighbors RSVP generates this system message. This system message may also be generated if the ACL is subsequently changed so that it re-associates RSVP neighbors with the specified key chain. If RSVP is not using another key chain for the set of RSVP neighbors specified by the ACL RSVP will begin using the specified key chain to exchange authenticated RSVP messages with that set of RSVP neighbors potentially restoring RSVP functionality with those neighbors."
