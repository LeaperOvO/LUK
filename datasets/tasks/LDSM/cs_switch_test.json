The limit may be reached during normal operation if a PITR discovers a large number of dynamic hosts in the EID-prefix ranges enabled for dynamic learning. If the dynamic local database size limit is reached new hosts will not be discovered. It is worth noting that it is normal for the local database to have a limit for dynamic entries for example to set an upper limit on the amount of memory required. To diagnose this issue it may be helpful to inspect the local database using show ip[v6] lisp [eid-table <vrf>] database. The entries can also be cleared with clear lisp[eid-table <vrf>] dynamic-eid.

RSVP uses the specified key chain to authenticate each RSVP message exchanged with that set of RSVP neighbors after the association is configured.

This causes RSVP to search the configuration for another suitable key chain to use with those neighbors. If no such key chain is found RSVP will no longer be able to provide authentication for messages exchanged with those RSVP neighbors. This causes RSVP to discard RSVP messages from that set of neighbors. Because this may ultimately lead to loss of RSVP functionality with those neighbors RSVP generates this system message. This system message may also be generated if the ACL is subsequently changed so that it re-associates RSVP neighbors with the specified key chain. If RSVP is not using another key chain for the set of RSVP neighbors specified by the ACL RSVP will begin using the specified key chain to exchange authenticated RSVP messages with that set of RSVP neighbors potentially restoring RSVP functionality with those neighbors."

The limit may be reached during normal operation if a PITR encounters traffic to many different EID-prefixes though this may also occur if someone is performing an address-space scan. If the cache size limit is reached new entries will replace old/inactive ones as required. If the map-cache limit is set too low actively used EID-to-RLOC mappings may be replaced continously which causes traffic to be dropped while these mappings are re-acquired. As long as only inactive map-cache entries are replaced the impact should not be significant. Furthermore it is worth noting that it is normal for the cache to have a limit for example to set an upper limit on the amount of memory required. To diagnose this issue it may be helpful to inspect the map-cache using show ip[v6] lisp [eid-table <vrf>] map-cache. It can also be cleared with clear ip[v6] lisp [eid-table <vrf>] map-cache. This syslog message can be turned off by removing the warning-threshold <percentage> configuration statement from the map-cache-limit configuration."
