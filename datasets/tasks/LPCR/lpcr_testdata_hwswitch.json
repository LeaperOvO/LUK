Parameters in the brackets indicate the address pool name and number of idle IP addresses.No IP address is available for allocation in the address pool. You can run thedisplay ip poolcommand to check the number of idle IP addresses. Here, the command output indicates that the number of idle IP addresses is 0.103DHCP IP POOL LOCKED(Pool name:name)The address pool is locked. The parameter in the brackets indicates the address pool name.The address pool is locked using thelockcommand in the address pool view.104NOT FIND IP POOL (Receive from interface:if, interface ip:ip. Relay ip:ip. Expect ip:ip)The address pool corresponding to the client-expected IP address is not found. Parameters in the brackets indicate the Layer 3 interface that receives the DHCP Request packet, IP address of the interface, IP address of the DHCP relay agent, and client-expected IP address.Possible cause 1:When a client is associated with an SSID, the client applies for an IP address in two-message exchange mode. That is, the client sends a DHCP Request packet carrying the expected IP address in Option50. The expected IP address is the address that the client has used before.If the client-expected IP address is on a different network segment from the client gateway address or the address pool corresponding to the client-expected IP address cannot be found, the DHCP server will fail to allocate this IP address. In this case, the DHCP server generates this log and returns a DHCP NAK packet to notify the client to apply for an IP address in four-message exchange mode, that is, the client sends a DHCP Discover packet to request for a new address.The network segment is changed when the client switches to another service VLAN.Possible cause 2:The DHCP server receives a DHCP Discover packet from the client. However, only thedhcp select globalcommand is run on the server and no corresponding address pool is created. As a result, the DHCP server generates this log and does not return any packet.This case rarely occurs.105INCORRECT REQUEST IP OR MAC (Ip:ipMAC:mac)The DHCP server cannot allocate the client-expected IP address. Parameters in the brackets indicate the client-expected IP address and client's MAC address.Possible cause 1:The DHCP server receives a DHCP Discover packet from the client. In the packet, the client-expected IP address is carried in Option50. When the client-expected IP address is not on the network segment of the address pool, the DHCP server generates this log and allocates a new IP address to the client.Possible cause 2:When a client is associated with an SSID, the client applies for an IP address in two-message exchange mode. That is, the client sends a DHCP Request packet carrying the expected IP address in Option50. The expected IP address is the address that the client has used before.If the client-expected IP address is within the address pool range but the address pool has no record about allocating any IP address to the client, the address pool does not respond to the request. The client waits till its request expires and begins to apply for a new IP address in four-message exchange mode.This log may be generated if the DHCP server restarts, IP address allocation records are manually cleared using thereset ip poolcommand, or a client exception occurs (for example, the client still uses an IP address after the address expires).106IP CONFLICTED(The conflict ip:ip)An IP address conflict occurs. The parameter in the brackets indicates the conflicted IP address.An IP address conflict is detected when the DHCP server allocates an IP address to a client. The address pool then sets the IP address status to conflicting and allocates a new IP address to the client.If the client-expected IP address is displayed as 255.255.255.255, the client does not expect any specific IP address."], ["The SEL log is full."], ["The IGMP snooping module receives a port Up event, but the interface status is Down in the display command output."], ["The statistical function of the PW was not enabled."], ["1.

Parameters in the brackets indicate the address pool name and number of idle IP addresses.No IP address is available for allocation in the address pool. You can run thedisplay ip poolcommand to check the number of idle IP addresses. Here, the command output indicates that the number of idle IP addresses is 0.103DHCP IP POOL LOCKED(Pool name:name)The address pool is locked. The parameter in the brackets indicates the address pool name.The address pool is locked using thelockcommand in the address pool view.104NOT FIND IP POOL (Receive from interface:if, interface ip:ip. Relay ip:ip. Expect ip:ip)The address pool corresponding to the client-expected IP address is not found. Parameters in the brackets indicate the Layer 3 interface that receives the DHCP Request packet, IP address of the interface, IP address of the DHCP relay agent, and client-expected IP address.Possible cause 1:When a client is associated with an SSID, the client applies for an IP address in two-message exchange mode. That is, the client sends a DHCP Request packet carrying the expected IP address in Option50. The expected IP address is the address that the client has used before.If the client-expected IP address is on a different network segment from the client gateway address or the address pool corresponding to the client-expected IP address cannot be found, the DHCP server will fail to allocate this IP address. In this case, the DHCP server generates this log and returns a DHCP NAK packet to notify the client to apply for an IP address in four-message exchange mode, that is, the client sends a DHCP Discover packet to request for a new address.The network segment is changed when the client switches to another service VLAN.Possible cause 2:The DHCP server receives a DHCP Discover packet from the client. However, only thedhcp select globalcommand is run on the server and no corresponding address pool is created. As a result, the DHCP server generates this log and does not return any packet.This case rarely occurs.105INCORRECT REQUEST IP OR MAC (Ip:ipMAC:mac)The DHCP server cannot allocate the client-expected IP address. Parameters in the brackets indicate the client-expected IP address and client's MAC address.Possible cause 1:The DHCP server receives a DHCP Discover packet from the client. In the packet, the client-expected IP address is carried in Option50. When the client-expected IP address is not on the network segment of the address pool, the DHCP server generates this log and allocates a new IP address to the client.Possible cause 2:When a client is associated with an SSID, the client applies for an IP address in two-message exchange mode. That is, the client sends a DHCP Request packet carrying the expected IP address in Option50. The expected IP address is the address that the client has used before.If the client-expected IP address is within the address pool range but the address pool has no record about allocating any IP address to the client, the address pool does not respond to the request. The client waits till its request expires and begins to apply for a new IP address in four-message exchange mode.This log may be generated if the DHCP server restarts, IP address allocation records are manually cleared using thereset ip poolcommand, or a client exception occurs (for example, the client still uses an IP address after the address expires).106IP CONFLICTED(The conflict ip:ip)An IP address conflict occurs. The parameter in the brackets indicates the conflicted IP address.An IP address conflict is detected when the DHCP server allocates an IP address to a client. The address pool then sets the IP address status to conflicting and allocates a new IP address to the client.If the client-expected IP address is displayed as 255.255.255.255, the client does not expect any specific IP address."], ["The memory allocation failed."], ["The communication with the RADIUS authentication server was resumed."], ["The multicast index exceeded the maximum value."], ["The LSP buffer did not have sufficient space to clear the LSPs in the overload state."], ["Switching the working tunnel to the protection tunnel cannot be performed because the protection tunnel was unavailable."], ["Possible Causes\nWhen LDP sessions are configured with multiple links or local-remote adjacencys, link parameters may be inconsistent."], ["The RRPP failed to set policy."], ["The status of the TCP link between the switch andiMaster NCE-Campuschanges."], ["TCAM resource release failed."], ["Cause 1:\nThe authentication mode or authentication key of the received VRRP packets was inconsistent with that of the local switch.\nCause 2:\nAuthentication configured on one end is deleted."], ["Possible Causes\nA CRP_ADV packet with a non-multicast group address was received."]], ["SHELL/4/ENABLECMDFAIL:Failed to enable command \"[command]\" under command mode [command-view].", "A failure occurred when the user enabled the command through IPC.", ["See the description in the procedure."], ["Attack source tracing, CAR, whitelist configuration,\nblacklist configuration, IP Source Trail, storm control, traffic-pppoe,deception,or suppression on broadcast,\nunknown multicast, or unknown unicast packets in VLANs fails."], ["The number of VPLS VCs created reached the maximum number of VPLS VCs allowed."], ["The LLS capability bit in the Hello packet received from the neighboring node was not set."], ["\u00b7The server was unreachable.\n \u00b7The password was incorrect.\n \u00b7The user name was inexistent or the path to the server was inexistent."], ["A board or a subcard is removed manually.The connection between a board or a subcard and the slot is loose."], ["The interface card was plugged in the board."], ["An error occurred in active board backup or the backup failed."], ["The OCSP certificate does not exist.The OCSP certificate is being used by services."], ["The sequence number of the LSP on the pseudo node was invalid."], ["The battery software is upgraded successfully."], ["The communication with the RADIUS authentication server is resumed.

Parameters in the brackets indicate the Layer 3 interface that receives the DHCP Request packet, IP address of the interface, IP address of the DHCP relay agent, and client-expected IP address.Possible cause 1:When a client is associated with an SSID, the client applies for an IP address in two-message exchange mode. That is, the client sends a DHCP Request packet carrying the expected IP address in Option50. The expected IP address is the address that the client has used before.If the client-expected IP address is on a different network segment from the client gateway address or the address pool corresponding to the client-expected IP address cannot be found, the DHCP server will fail to allocate this IP address. In this case, the DHCP server generates this log and returns a DHCP NAK packet to notify the client to apply for an IP address in four-message exchange mode, that is, the client sends a DHCP Discover packet to request for a new address.The network segment is changed when the client switches to another service VLAN.Possible cause 2:The DHCP server receives a DHCP Discover packet from the client. However, only thedhcp select globalcommand is run on the server and no corresponding address pool is created. As a result, the DHCP server generates this log and does not return any packet.This case rarely occurs.105INCORRECT REQUEST IP OR MAC (Ip:ipMAC:mac)The DHCP server cannot allocate the client-expected IP address. Parameters in the brackets indicate the client-expected IP address and client's MAC address.Possible cause 1:The DHCP server receives a DHCP Discover packet from the client. In the packet, the client-expected IP address is carried in Option50. When the client-expected IP address is not on the network segment of the address pool, the DHCP server generates this log and allocates a new IP address to the client.Possible cause 2:When a client is associated with an SSID, the client applies for an IP address in two-message exchange mode. That is, the client sends a DHCP Request packet carrying the expected IP address in Option50. The expected IP address is the address that the client has used before.If the client-expected IP address is within the address pool range but the address pool has no record about allocating any IP address to the client, the address pool does not respond to the request. The client waits till its request expires and begins to apply for a new IP address in four-message exchange mode.This log may be generated if the DHCP server restarts, IP address allocation records are manually cleared using thereset ip poolcommand, or a client exception occurs (for example, the client still uses an IP address after the address expires).106IP CONFLICTED(The conflict ip:ip)An IP address conflict occurs. The parameter in the brackets indicates the conflicted IP address.An IP address conflict is detected when the DHCP server allocates an IP address to a client. The address pool then sets the IP address status to conflicting and allocates a new IP address to the client.If the client-expected IP address is displayed as 255.255.255.255, the client does not expect any specific IP address."], ["The CSS has been upgraded successfully using ISSU."], ["The number of users in quiet state reached the upper alarm threshold."], ["Possible Causes\nThe number of dynamic ARP entries falls below the specification."]], ["USBLOAD/3/PROCESS_SUCCESS: Usbload process success.

Parameters in the brackets indicate the address pool name and number of idle IP addresses.No IP address is available for allocation in the address pool. You can run thedisplay ip poolcommand to check the number of idle IP addresses. Here, the command output indicates that the number of idle IP addresses is 0.103DHCP IP POOL LOCKED(Pool name:name)The address pool is locked. The parameter in the brackets indicates the address pool name.The address pool is locked using thelockcommand in the address pool view.104NOT FIND IP POOL (Receive from interface:if, interface ip:ip. Relay ip:ip. Expect ip:ip)The address pool corresponding to the client-expected IP address is not found. Parameters in the brackets indicate the Layer 3 interface that receives the DHCP Request packet, IP address of the interface, IP address of the DHCP relay agent, and client-expected IP address.Possible cause 1:When a client is associated with an SSID, the client applies for an IP address in two-message exchange mode. That is, the client sends a DHCP Request packet carrying the expected IP address in Option50. The expected IP address is the address that the client has used before.If the client-expected IP address is on a different network segment from the client gateway address or the address pool corresponding to the client-expected IP address cannot be found, the DHCP server will fail to allocate this IP address. In this case, the DHCP server generates this log and returns a DHCP NAK packet to notify the client to apply for an IP address in four-message exchange mode, that is, the client sends a DHCP Discover packet to request for a new address.The network segment is changed when the client switches to another service VLAN.Possible cause 2:The DHCP server receives a DHCP Discover packet from the client. However, only thedhcp select globalcommand is run on the server and no corresponding address pool is created. As a result, the DHCP server generates this log and does not return any packet.This case rarely occurs.105INCORRECT REQUEST IP OR MAC (Ip:ipMAC:mac)The DHCP server cannot allocate the client-expected IP address. Parameters in the brackets indicate the client-expected IP address and client's MAC address.Possible cause 1:The DHCP server receives a DHCP Discover packet from the client. In the packet, the client-expected IP address is carried in Option50. When the client-expected IP address is not on the network segment of the address pool, the DHCP server generates this log and allocates a new IP address to the client.Possible cause 2:When a client is associated with an SSID, the client applies for an IP address in two-message exchange mode. That is, the client sends a DHCP Request packet carrying the expected IP address in Option50. The expected IP address is the address that the client has used before.If the client-expected IP address is within the address pool range but the address pool has no record about allocating any IP address to the client, the address pool does not respond to the request. The client waits till its request expires and begins to apply for a new IP address in four-message exchange mode.This log may be generated if the DHCP server restarts, IP address allocation records are manually cleared using thereset ip poolcommand, or a client exception occurs (for example, the client still uses an IP address after the address expires).106IP CONFLICTED(The conflict ip:ip)An IP address conflict occurs. The parameter in the brackets indicates the conflicted IP address.An IP address conflict is detected when the DHCP server allocates an IP address to a client. The address pool then sets the IP address status to conflicting and allocates a new IP address to the client.If the client-expected IP address is displayed as 255.255.255.255, the client does not expect any specific IP address."], ["Normal startup process."], ["The packet received from the peer contained an unsupported code of a sub-address family."], ["The MAC address matching the MFF gateway's IP address changes."], ["The length of a POST authentication request packet\nexceeds 1024 bytes."], ["The level value was incorrect when a virtual ID was configured to set up an LSP set."], ["New BFD configurations were still committed when the number of global BFD sessions reached the upper limit"], ["The user decides whether to reboot the system before running this command."], ["The single-cell discharge temperature range for a\nlithium battery is -5\u00b0C to +50\u00b0C, and the charge temperature range\nis 0\u00b0C to 45\u00b0C.
