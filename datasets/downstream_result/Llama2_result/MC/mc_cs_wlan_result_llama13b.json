  "  Based on the log message \"Checkpointing transmit message header transformation failed\", I would say that the log comes from the CAPWAP module.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* The log message mentions \"checkpointing\", which is a CAPWAP-specific feature that allows the AP to save its current state and resume transmitting after a restart.\n* The log message also mentions a \"transmit message header transformation failed\", which suggests that there was an issue with the header of a transmitted message. This is a common issue in CAPWAP, as the header is used to carry important information such as the message type, source and destination addresses, and sequencing information.\n* Finally, the log message does not seem to be related to any other module, as it does not mention any other specific component or feature. Therefore, it is most likely that the log comes from the CAPWAP module."
