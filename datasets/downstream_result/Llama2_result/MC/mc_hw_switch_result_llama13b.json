Here are some possible modules that may be relevant to this issue:\n\n1. LDP (Label Distribution Protocol): This module is responsible for distributing labels to different FECs in the network.\n2. GR (Graceful Restart): This module is responsible for handling GR messages and restoring the network to a consistent state after a failure.\n3. FEC (Forwarding Equivalence Class): This module is responsible for grouping different labels together based on their forwarding equivalence.\n\nTo troubleshoot this issue, I would suggest checking the following:\n\n1. LDP configuration: Verify that the LDP configuration is correct and that the correct labels are being allocated to the appropriate FECs.\n2. GR process: Verify that the GR process is functioning correctly and that the network is being restored to a consistent state after a failure.\n3.
