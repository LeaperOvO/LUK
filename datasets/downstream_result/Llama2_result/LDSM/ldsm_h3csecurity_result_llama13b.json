Reason: AP model [$1] is not supported.\n\nDescription: The AP fails to come online because its model is not supported by the AC and the AC cannot receive discovery requests from the AP.\n\nMatch: True\n\nExplanation: The log message and the description both indicate that the AP's model is not supported by the AC, which is the reason for the AP's failure to come online. This is a clear match."
