After the Powerup Self Test is passed, it will switch to the Mode Init state. If the self-check fails, it will directly switch to the Fatal Error state. When the system is in non-FIPS mode, the state machine switches from the Mode Init state to the None Fips state, and the state machine does not change anymore; when the system is in FIPS mode, the state machine switches to the Ready state. Condition Self Test is temporarily triggered by a scheduled task or business. When the self-check passes, it returns to the Ready state. If the self-check fails, it records Software Error and tries to repair it. If the repair succeeds, it returns to the Ready state, and the repair fails to switch to the Fatal Error state."

Changes in network traffic patterns or session limits could impact port functionality and lead to a physical down state.\n\n12.

Configuration changes or issues with IS-IS could impact port functionality.\n\n13.

This could result in a port physical down event if connectivity issues are not resolved.\n\n14. (75/100) The number of fast forwarding resources exceed the threshold. Resource limitations could impact port functionality and lead to a physical down state.\n\n15. (70/100) The IIH packet in which the restart TLV has the RA bit was received during IS-IS GR.
